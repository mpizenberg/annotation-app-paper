\section{Presentation of the application}

A screenshot of the application can be seen on Figure~\ref{fig:teaser}.
The image to be annotated occupies the central part of the screen;
a tool bar is located on top, object classes are available on the left
and images to be annotated on the right.


\textbf{Images}.
Multiple images can be loaded at the same time using the image icon
on the top-right part of the application.
These images are not uploaded on the server,
and can either be loaded locally from the client's machine,
or from a distant server.

\textbf{Tools}.
Our application includes several tools to annotate images.
Icons for these tools are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:icons}.
From left to right, the first available annotation is the point,
that can be useful to designate objects on the image.
It can also be used as a seed in region-growing image segmentation methods.
The second annotation we included is the bounding box,
which provides the localization of objects in the image,
and is used in object detection problems.
The bounding box information we acquire are the coordinates of the top-left point,
as well as width and height of the rectangle.

% A l'export, c'est plutot au format xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax il me semble

The third annotation we chose to implement is the stroke,
or scribble, which is a popular interaction in image segmentation.
It consists in a sequence of points, interpreted as a continuous line.
Outlines, the fourth type of annotations,
are closed shapes to be typically drawn around objects.
It is comparable to bounding boxes in essence,
but provides a more precise localization of objects.
Finally, polygons can also be drawn (as in LabelMe, for instance),
by successively clicking new points as vertices.


All these tools can be used both with a mouse or on a touch device.

As a matter of fact, some tools are better suited to touch devices
(for example, outlines) than others (polygons).

\textbf{Object classes}.
For most annotation tasks, we also need to differentiate objects in the images.
Typically each annotated area is attributed a class, or label.
The PASCAL VOC dataset~\cite{everingham2010pascal}, for example,
is composed of 20 classes, grouped by categories. Those classes are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Person}: person
\item \textit{Animal}: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
\item \textit{Vehicle}: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train
\item \textit{Indoor}: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor
\end{itemize}

In our application, classes are specified in a JSON configuration file.
A strict corresponding config for PASCAL VOC classes
would be as the (Listing~\ref{lst:pascal}).

\lstinputlisting[language=json,caption={A configuration file to annotate the PASCAL dataset.},float,label={lst:pascal}]{code/config-pascal.json}

To attribute a class to an annotation,
a user should first select the class in the left sidebar,
then use a tool to create an annotation.
Selecting a class in the left sidebar also highlights the annotations
corresponding to this class.


\textbf{Configuration file}.
The five annotation tools can be made available or not
using the configuration file as well.
In Listing~\ref{lst:pascal}, the last line of the depicted configuration file
contains an \texttt{annotation} field, that can be used to show any of the tools.
In that case, all tools are present.

In addition to the five fundamental annotation types available,
each type can be derived in virtually any number of variations.
For example, interactive segmentation algorithms often require
\textit{foreground} and \textit{background} scribbles.
In our application, this would mean the user would need to draw two types of strokes.
This can be achieved using the configuration file,
as in listing~\ref{lst:variations}.
Such configuration would result in two stroke icons in the tool bar,
of different colors, just as in Figure~\ref{fig:teaser}.
