\section{Crowdsourcing annotations}

Image annotation interfaces are often used in the context
of large datasets of images to annotate.
As such, tasks management for crowdsourcing campaigns is an important feature. 
Labelbox and Dataturks are all-in-one services providing
tasks management directly in their applications.
Just like LabelMe, we choose instead to provide a configuration,
ready to use with Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk).

Mturk comes in two sides. A ``requester'' is defining a set of tasks
while a ``worker'' is performing them.
Workers are payed by requesters through Mturk service.
The concept of a ``HIT'' (Human Intelligence Task) characterizes the task unit.
In our case, one HIT means one image to be annotated.
We describe in details how to setup a campaign with our template
in the application documentation.
